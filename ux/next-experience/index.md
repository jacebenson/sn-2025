[📄 - Maik Skoddow - UI Builder](https://www.servicenow.com/community/next-experience-articles/platform-ui-builder-knowledge-amp-troubleshooting-resources/ta-p/2590956)

UI Builder is where you can make changes to or create new "Experiences".  This editor feels a lot like the AppSmith, ToolJet, and Retool.  

There's a few sections.  There's a left hand side that shows you the elements under the *content* section.  Below that there's a *Data and Scripts* section that has *Data Resources* which are special (we'll get into these more detailed on separate pages).  On the far right you have the *Configuration* section that shows you the configuration of the Content you picked.  In the configuration tab is a Configure, Styles and Events tab.  Configure what is required to make the component work.  Styles is the CSS for the component.  Events are another bit we'll talk about in more details.
