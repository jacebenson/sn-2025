To change the Lists on the left of a workspace there are a few tables involved and they don't show up in UI Builder.

Cool Beans.

1. UX List Categories (`sys_ux_list_category`): These are the "containers" or what I would have called the "applications" in the classic UI.
2. UX List (`sys_ux_list`): These are the actual lists that show up under the categories.
3. Audience (`sys_ux_applicability_list`): These define who can see these things.
4. M2M Applicibility (`sys_ux_applicability_m2m_list`): These connect the lists/categories to audiences.
