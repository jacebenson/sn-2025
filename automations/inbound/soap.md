SOAP I don't even know that stands for.  Is it kind of integration that uses xml for everything
Servicenow uses xml for everything as well so it makes sense that soap was there from the beginning

Soap though is very brittle you need a fine what the payload's going to be like and you needed to find all these different bits to make this stuff workI've only had to use this twice in the 25 years I've worked on this tool.  It's good to know that you can do it but I'd highly encourage you to not use soap if you can
