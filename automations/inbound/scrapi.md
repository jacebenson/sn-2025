 Scripted rests API is otherwise known as SCRAPIs, Are very versatile and can do almost anything you need to within ServiceNow from an API perspectivethe only thing is that I found that I can't do with scripted rest apisare generating files to be downloadedand sometimes handling headers in a very specific way.

 In those situations you'll have to look at the predecessors descriptive rest Apis which I would say are processors.  Processors have sent have been sent deprecated but you can still create them and use them they're just not nearly as common.
