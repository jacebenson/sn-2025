REST APIs are prolific throughout the Internet now they are very common and used everywhere.

There are a lot of common REST APIs that service now gives you that are used extensively the most common would be the table api.

The table api has a get to get a singular record it has a get to get many records it has a post to create new records a patched update records and a delete to delete records.

There are lots of other apis that exist in service now using REST today and there's even a thing called the REST API Explorer where you can check some of these things out without any software on your computer which is fantastic that being said there are some APIs older soap end points that are just better for instance the attachment api doesn't allow you to create records unless you definitely attach them to a recordsometimes you may not want to do that in those cases this soap attachment API is better.
