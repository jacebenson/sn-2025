Scheduled scripts are one of the most powerful ways to run something in ServiceNow because it will always run as the systemand it will not stop running.  This is really useful if you need to fix something but you can't have a limit on how long it runs like you would with a fixed script or a background script.  Also when you make a scheduled scriptthat is a record in and of itself and a way to trace that it occurred.
