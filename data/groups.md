Groups in ServiceNow is the best way to manage who gets access to whatbut you can take groups too far and you can also leave groups not far enoughthe best implementation of how to manage groups in ServiceNow that I have found or seen is having a group that actually gives away the access and then having child groupsthat are connected to something likeazure orwhatever group management system you use for your identity access.
