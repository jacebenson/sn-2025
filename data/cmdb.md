The configuration management database and service now is one of the three main tables that exists

The configuration management database tableis paired with an asset tableit's important to understand how these are connected especially when considering products like software asset management and hardware asset managementhere's the differentiator the way I understand itasset records are all about the finances of the thing that's being trackedwhereas the configuration management database record is all about what it is and how it works.

There is this concept of another acronym called the Common Services data model or CSDM,  Really it's just how data needs to exist in ServiceNow on the CMDB tableto be used properly for all the products that you could possibly purchase
