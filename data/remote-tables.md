Remote tables is a relatively new feature it's only been around for about four or 5 years nowbut ever since I heard this older name for it i've never been able to see them the same and that namewas scripted tablesit's my belief that they called them remote tables so they could betterposition their integration hub product to make more money on selling connections and the costs of making those transactions

That being said there are a bunch of limitations to remote tables like one you can't have more than 1000 rows per remote table2 if you want a remote table and you want to let people search or filter it you need to build those wholemethods or implementations for each of these tablesbecause if you're connected to say a stock picker website where it lists every stock pick or stock ticker for every company and you want to sort by the price of those stocks or what the change was you'd have to then change your API call to return those in the right order or load the whole list and then sort them according to whatever column was sorted and by ascending or descending
