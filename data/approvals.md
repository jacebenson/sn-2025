Approvals let the business stakeholders control how a process works by giving them the ability to approve or reject some process based on how you build them.My

It used to be that approvers were free with every contractand then they became paidforUI access and free for email approvers and then they became paid all the time.

This is really a travesty because this took away a lot of power that service now gave their customers letting them buildbespoke solutions for their business how their business did the workwithout breaking the bank.

That being said there are alternatives in ways to address thisthat don't require licenses for every business stakeholderI'm not going to list those alternatives here.
