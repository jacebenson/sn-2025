The scoped GlideAggregate class is an extension of GlideRecord and allows database aggregation (COUNT, SUM, MIN, MAX, AVG) queries to be done. This can be helpful in creating customized reports or in calculations for calculated fields. The GlideAggregate class works only on number fields. Since currency fields are strings, you can't use the GlideAggregate class on currency fields

The scoped [GlideAggregate](/reference/glideaggregate/) class is an extension of [GlideRecord](/reference/gliderecord/) and allows database aggregation (COUNT, SUM, MIN, MAX, AVG) queries to be done.

## addAggregate
Adds an aggregate
```js
var count = new GlideAggregate('io_set_item');
//parm1: COUNT, MIN, MAX, parm2: field
count.addAggregate('COUNT', 'variable_set');
count.query();
while (count.next()) {
   var set = count.variable_set.getDisplayValue();
   var setCount = count.getAggregate('COUNT', 'variable_set');
   var message = "The are currently " + setCount;
   message += " items with a variable set of " + set;
   gs.print(message);
}
/*Output
[0:00:00.345] Script completed in scope global: script
*** Script: The are currently 1 items with a variable set of Generic Request
*** Script: The are currently 154 items with a variable set of Request For
*/
```

## getAggregate
Gets an aggregate

```js
var count = new GlideAggregate('io_set_item');
//parm1: COUNT, MIN, MAX, parm2: field
count.addAggregate('COUNT', 'variable_set');

while (count.next()) {
   var set = count.variable_set.getDisplayValue();
