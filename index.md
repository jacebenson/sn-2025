## Where else can I find this stuff or talk with others?

1. {% iconCard 'Official API Reference', 'This is also refered to as the [Product Docs](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/csh?topicname=c_GlideRecordScopedAPI.html&version=latest).' %}
2. {% iconCard 'Official Developer API Reference', 'This was my favorite, unfortunately you can only link to a specific family version of the docs.  Here\'s the [top level link](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/reference).' %}
3. {% iconCard 'Developer Learning (not learning.servicenow.com)', '[These frustrate me to a new level](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/learn/courses/yokohama/app_store_learnv2_scripting_yokohama_scripting_in_servicenow/app_store_learnv2_scripting_yokohama_server_side_scripting/app_store_learnv2_scripting_yokohama_gliderecord).  They are not as complete as the Developer API Reference or the Product Docs but rank higher on Search Enginers.  I avoid them.' %}
