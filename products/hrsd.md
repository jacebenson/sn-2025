ServiceNow started with IT Service Management (ITSM).  

ITSM has always contained the following.

1. Incident
2. Problem
3. Change
4. Request (Service Catalog)
5. Knowledge

However over time things have been added and depending **when** you've purchashed and at what level you may have more things.

<details>
  <summary>Asset Management</summary>
  This is the "pre-SAM" offering.  You can build all the stuff Software Asset Managements does on top of this (ITAM) but ServiceNow has not updated this in a meaningful way in years.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Cost Management</summary>
  I have no idea what this is.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Walk-Up Experience</summary>
  I've seen customers be forced into a new SKU to acquire this to get them off of an old grandfathered SKU.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Spokes and Protocols</summary>
  This has limits and costs per call for some of the features.
